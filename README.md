I found the task 2.2 requires the implementation of Astar algo (along with some others for inheritances), so I did my version of AStar for the Euclidean heauristic for now. For how to use, see the readme inside them.

If any other implementations are done already, simply removes all my files and upload yours in the master, I put them in the Michael branch as well so no worry.
